## Overview

HotView Labs is a leading tech research and development company, dedicated to providing the most accurate and up-to-date insights to tech leaders worldwide. Our new responsive blog interface will allow users to access dynamic blog posts, while also providing a robust admin interface for managing content.

## Description

This project involves designing and building a responsive front-end interface for an existing blogging API. The application will include both public-facing pages for users to view and interact with blog posts, and admin pages for authorized users to manage content. Key features include:

   - An interactive blog feed page with a carousel of the latest posts and a grid of the most recent 12 posts.
   - Detailed blog post pages with shareable URLs.
   - Admin pages for login, registration, and post management.

## Features
### Blog Feed Page

   - Interactive Banner Carousel: Users can view and navigate through the latest three blog posts, with smooth transitions and clickable buttons to view full posts.
   - Post Grid: A responsive grid displaying the latest 12 blog posts, each clickable to navigate to the full post.
   - Pagination: Users can navigate through multiple pages of blog posts beyond the initial 12.
   - Sorting & Filtering: Users can sort posts by date, popularity, or category and filter them based on tags or categories.
   - Search Functionality: Users can search for specific posts using keywords.

### Blog Post Public Page

   - Responsive Layout: Displays post title, author, publication date, image banner, and content.
   - Shareable URL: Each post has a unique, shareable URL containing the post ID.

### Blog Post Edit Page
